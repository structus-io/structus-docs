# Roadmap & Future Projects

This page outlines the planned future developments for the Structus ecosystem. While the core library provides a solid foundation for implementing clean architecture in Kotlin, we have ambitious plans to expand its capabilities and integrations.

## Upcoming Projects

### Structus CLI Tool

A command-line interface tool to help you generate boilerplate code, create new projects, and implement common patterns with Structus.

**Planned Features:**
- Project scaffolding with various templates (basic, CQRS, event sourcing)
- Code generation for entities, value objects, repositories, and handlers
- Migration tools for existing projects
- Integration with build systems (Gradle, Maven)

**Timeline:** Q2 2024

### Spring Boot Starter Library

A dedicated Spring Boot starter that simplifies integration of Structus with Spring Boot applications.

**Planned Features:**
- Auto-configuration of common Structus components
- Spring-specific adapters and extensions
- Support for Spring Data with Structus repositories
- Integration with Spring's transaction management
- Support for Spring's validation framework

**Timeline:** Q3 2024

### TypeScript/JavaScript Support

A TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of Structus concepts to enable clean architecture in frontend applications and Node.js backends.

**Planned Features:**
- Core domain modeling primitives (Entity, ValueObject, AggregateRoot)
- CQRS implementation for TypeScript
- Integration with popular frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
- NPM packages for easy integration
- Full documentation and examples

**Timeline:** Q4 2024

### Multiplatform Support

Extend Structus to support Kotlin Multiplatform for true cross-platform clean architecture.

**Planned Features:**
- Common core library with multiplatform support
- Platform-specific adapters for JVM, JS, Native
- Shared domain models across platforms
- Consistent API across all platforms

**Timeline:** Q1 2025

### Structus Studio IDE Plugin

A dedicated IDE plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs to enhance the development experience with Structus.

**Planned Features:**
- Visual domain modeling tools
- Code generation and templates
- Architecture validation and analysis
- Visualization of dependencies
- Quick navigation between related components

**Timeline:** Q2 2025
