# About Structus

## Creator

**Structus** was created by **[Mel Sardes](https://github.com/melsardes)**, a software developer passionate about clean architecture and domain-driven design *(He uses Arch btw)*.

- 💼 **Project**: [structus-kotlin](https://github.com/structus-io/structus-kotlin)

## Vision

Structus was born from the need for a framework-agnostic, pure Kotlin library that enforces clean architecture principles. The goal is to provide developers with a solid foundation for building maintainable, testable, and scalable applications using Explicit Architecture patterns.

## Philosophy

The library is built on these core principles:

1. **Framework Independence**: No vendor lock-in, works with any framework
2. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Clear contracts and boundaries
3. **Testability First**: Easy to test in isolation
4. **Coroutine Native**: Built for modern asynchronous Kotlin
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only what's absolutely necessary

## Inspiration

Structus is inspired by the work of:

- **Herberto Graça** - [Explicit Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/)
- **Eric Evans** - Domain-Driven Design
- **Vaughn Vernon** - Implementing Domain-Driven Design
- **Robert C. Martin** - Clean Architecture
- **Greg Young** - CQRS and Event Sourcing
