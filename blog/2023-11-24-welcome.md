# Welcome to Structus Documentation

We're excited to announce the launch of the official Structus documentation website!

## What is Structus?

Structus is a pure Kotlin JVM library that provides the foundational building blocks for implementing **Explicit Architecture** - a synthesis of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command/Query Separation (CQS), and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).

## Why We Built This

Modern software development demands clean, maintainable, and testable code. However, many teams struggle with:

- **Framework Lock-in**: Tightly coupled to specific frameworks
- **Mixed Concerns**: Business logic scattered across layers
- **Testing Difficulties**: Hard to test in isolation
- **Unclear Boundaries**: No clear separation between layers

Structus solves these problems by providing a framework-agnostic foundation that enforces clean architecture principles.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Pure Kotlin
No framework dependencies. Works with Spring Boot, Ktor, Micronaut, Quarkus, or pure Kotlin applications.

### 🔄 Coroutine-Ready
All I/O operations use suspend functions, making it perfect for modern asynchronous applications.

### 📦 Minimal Dependencies
Only Kotlin stdlib and kotlinx-coroutines-core. Nothing more.

### 🎨 Clean Architecture
Enforces proper layer separation and dependencies through well-defined interfaces.
